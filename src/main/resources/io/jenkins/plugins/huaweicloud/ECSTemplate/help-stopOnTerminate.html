    If you want to shut down the instance instead of releasing (deleting) the instance when the idle timeout expires, you can select this option.<br />
    <b>Note: When you shut down the instance, only the basic resources of the elastic cloud server (including vCPU, memory, and mirroring) will stop billing,
        while the cloud hard disk (system disk, data disk) and elastic public network IP will still be billed on demand.</b>
